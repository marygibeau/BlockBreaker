#Block Breaker
This is a block breaking game I made in the Unity engine using a course on udemy.com

#instructions
- move the mouse to control the paddle
- click to launch the ball upwards
- don't let the ball fall past the paddle
- red blocks take three hits to break, orange bricks take two hits to break, and yellow bricks only take one hit to break
- blue bricks are unbreakable
